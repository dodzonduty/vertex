# Future Changes for Landing Page

## Header Component
- **Dynamic Event Count**: Replace the hardcoded "24" in the "Events" badge. This number should reflect the live count of active events fetched from the database.

## Live Events Component
- **Dynamic Event Cards**: Remove the 3 hardcoded event cards.
- **Backend Integration**: Fetch the top 3 active events from the database, sorted by the highest number of participants, and display them dynamically.
